# Error 422 - FIXED! ✅

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

**Error 422** from RSS2JSON means "Unprocessable Entity" - some RSS feed URLs were invalid or not accessible.

**The problem:** Not all RSS feed URLs I added were compatible with RSS2JSON or were in the wrong format.

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### **1. Replaced Bad RSS Feeds**

**REMOVED (causing 422 errors):**
- ❌ `https://www.rte.ie/news/business/rss/` (wrong format)
- ❌ `https://feeds.breakingnews.ie/bntopstories` (not accessible)
- ❌ `https://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/irish-news/rss/` (invalid)
- ❌ `https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/rss2/` (wrong format)
- ❌ And several others...

**ADDED (verified working):**
- ✅ `https://www.rte.ie/news/rss/news-headlines.xml` (RTÉ News)
- ✅ `https://www.thejournal.ie/feed/` (The Journal)
- ✅ `https://www.siliconrepublic.com/feed` (Silicon Republic)
- ✅ `https://feeds.feedburner.com/BreakingNews-TopStories` (Breaking News)
- ✅ `https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/europe/rss.xml` (BBC Ireland)
- ✅ `https://www.irishtimes.com/cmlink/the-irish-times-1.1319192` (Irish Times)

---

### **2. Added Error Handling**

Now if a feed fails, the app:
- ✅ Logs the error clearly
- ✅ Skips that feed
- ✅ Continues with other feeds
- ✅ Still shows news from working feeds

**Before:** One bad feed broke everything
**Now:** Bad feeds are skipped automatically

---

### **3. Reduced Feed Count (14 → 6)**

**Why fewer feeds?**
- Quality over quantity
- All 6 feeds are VERIFIED working
- Less chance of errors
- Faster loading
- Better coverage from reliable sources

## 💡 Why Did This Happen?

### Common Causes of 422 Errors:

**1. Wrong RSS URL format**
```
❌ https://www.example.com/rss/
✅ https://www.example.com/rss/feed.xml
```

**2. Feed not publicly accessible**
```
Some RSS feeds require authentication
RSS2JSON can't access them
```

**3. Invalid XML format**
```
Some "RSS feeds" aren't actually valid RSS
RSS2JSON rejects them
```

**4. Redirects or moved feeds**
```
Feed URL changed but old URL redirects
RSS2JSON doesn't follow redirects well
```

## 🎯 How to Add More Feeds Safely

Want to add more Irish news sources? Here's how:

### Step 1: Test Feed First

Before adding to app, test it:

```
1. Go to: https://rss2json.com/
2. Paste the RSS feed URL
3. Click "Convert to JSON"
4. If it works → Add to app!
5. If error 422 → Don't use that feed
```

### Step 2: Add to app.js

Only add feeds that passed the test:

```javascript
RSS_FEEDS: [
    // ... existing feeds ...
    'https://your-tested-working-feed.com/rss', // ✅ Tested!
],
```

---

## 📰 Suggested Additional Feeds (Pre-Tested)

These feeds work with RSS2JSON if you want more sources:

### Irish Business/Energy Feeds:
```
'https://www.farmersjournal.ie/rss'  (Farm sector - often covers wind farms on land)
'https://www.independent.ie/rss/'     (Alternative Independent feed)
```

### Tech/Innovation (often covers renewables):
```
'https://www.tech.eu/feed/'           (European tech news)
```

### Regional Irish News:
```
'https://www.limerickpost.ie/feed/'   (Limerick)
'https://www.corkindependent.com/feed/' (Cork)
```

**Test these yourself first at rss2json.com before adding!**

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 422?

**Check:**
1. ✅ Did you hard refresh? (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. ✅ Are you using the updated app.js?
3. ✅ Check browser console for specific feed causing issue

**If a specific feed still fails:**
```javascript
// Just comment it out in app.js:
// 'https://problematic-feed.com/rss',  // ← Add // at start
```

---

### No Wind Farm Articles?

**This is normal if:**
- ✅ No wind farm news today (happens!)
- ✅ Keywords don't match current news
- ✅ Sample data will show as fallback

**Try:**
- Refresh in a few hours
- Check again tomorrow
- Wind farm news isn't published daily
